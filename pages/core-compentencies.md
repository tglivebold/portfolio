### **BRANDING**

### **BRAND STRATEGY**

A strong brand begins with clarity — of mission, message, and meaning. I work with organizations to define their voice, align visual identity with values, and build systems that scale across teams, platforms, and partnerships.

**The Work:**  
Led the brand narrative and positioning for a church coalition’s “Campaign for Kindness,” a national movement launched during the election season to counter polarization. From messaging to press strategy, the campaign invited people to “vote for kindness” and was picked up in multiple media outlets.

**CAMPAIGN DEVELOPMENT**

Mission-driven campaigns must do more than look good — they need to move people. I build integrated campaigns that connect the message to the moment with clear objectives, creative delivery, and measurable outcomes.

**The Work:**  
Developed and executed a campaign for the “Save the Sage Grouse” initiative in Colorado. The campaign included a 30-day fundraising push followed by a 6-month donor retargeting strategy using short-form videos, banner ads, and social content — helping raise $100K+ and expand the donor base.

**MESSAGING & COMMUNICATION STRATEGY**

Whether guiding through a crisis, leading a rebrand, or scaling a movement, I craft communication systems that keep internal teams focused and external stakeholders informed, inspired, and engaged.

**The Work:**  
When a nonprofit experienced a leadership scandal, I led the crisis communication and leadership transition strategy — including internal town halls, public statements, reputation management, and support for a full organizational rebrand. This approach preserved donor trust and repositioned the organization for growth.

### **NARRATIVE & CONTENT DESIGN**

Storytelling is the bridge between your values and your audience. I shape narratives that reflect an organization’s mission — from launch copy and speeches to social media scripts, websites, and thought leadership.

**The Work:**  
Wrote and distributed a national press release for the “Campaign for Kindness,” highlighting the initiative’s core message and reaching outlets nationwide. Also supported content development for community conversations and engagement events leading up to the midterm elections.
